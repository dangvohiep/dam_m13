This dataset includes tables for artists, albums, tracks, and more. \n","\n","Unlike relational databases that use tables, a graph database uses nodes and relationships, offering a more intuitive and flexible way to represent and navigate complex connections in our data. By converting the Chinook dataset into a graph structure, we aim to explore these benefits, particularly how they enhance data relationships and query efficiency. This transition is not just about changing how data is stored, but also about adopting a new approach to data modeling and retrieval."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Part 2: PostgreSQL to Neo4j Migration"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Exporting Postgresql tables to csv files:\n","\n","To export tables from our `chinook` Postgresql database to the import folder of Neo4j as CSV files, we need to execute these commands:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["`\n","\\pqsl\n","`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["`\n","\\c chinook\n","`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["`\n","\\copy (SELECT * FROM \"Artist\") to '/Users/hiepdang/Library/Application Support/Neo4j Desktop/Application/relate-data/dbmss/dbms-007decab-4416-4815-a018-18cd175c4a82/import/Artist.csv' with csv header\n","`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["`\n","\\copy (SELECT * FROM \"Album\") to '/Users/hiepdang/Library/Application Support/Neo4j Desktop/Application/relate-data/dbmss/dbms-007decab-4416-4815-a018-18cd175c4a82/import/Album.csv' with csv header\n","`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["`\n","\\copy (SELECT * FROM \"Track\") to '/Users/hiepdang/Library/Application Support/Neo4j Desktop/Application/relate-data/dbmss/dbms-007decab-4416-4815-a018-18cd175c4a82/import/Track.csv' with csv header\n","`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["`\n","\\copy (SELECT * FROM \"Genre\") to '/Users/hiepdang/Library/Application Support/Neo4j Desktop/Application/relate-data/dbmss/dbms-007decab-4416-4815-a018-18cd175c4a82/import/Genre.csv' with csv header\n","`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["`\n","\\copy (SELECT * FROM \"MediaType\") to '/Users/hiepdang/Library/Application Support/Neo4j Desktop/Application/relate-data/dbmss/dbms-007decab-4416-4815-a018-18cd175c4a82/import/MediaType.csv' with csv header\n","`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Neo4j Database Schema:\n","\n","In a graph database like Neo4j:\n","\n","- Nodes are analogous to rows in a table.<br>\n","- Relationships connect nodes are similar to foreign key relationships in relational databases.<br>\n","- Properties are similar to the columns in a table.<br>\n","- Labels categorize nodes and can be used like a table name in SQL.<br>\n","\n","Here's a proposed Neo4j schema:\n","\n","#### Nodes:\n","\n","1.
